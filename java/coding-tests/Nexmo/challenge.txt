The challenge is to build a simple version of a 'hangman' game as a web-app (look & feel is not important). The app should use jquery and ajax queries for interaction. The app should keep the current game state persistent across server and browser re-starts. Preferably the app should be built with 'ant' and produce a war file that can be deployed in a tomcat. But note that we're primarily interested in the Java server-side implementation, so if you're not familiar with any particular technology listed here ask me if you can skip or substitute that technology, we're flexible about about most of it.

The app should have a 'management' page that shows a summary of the state of all games that are currently being played Primarily, we’re looking for clean and readable code and a sound design approach.
