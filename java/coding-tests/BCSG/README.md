# solution

## How to build
Running mvn package will create two jar files in /target directory. The "bcsg-solution-jar-with-dependencies.jar" is configured to be executable.


## How to Run:
Run java - jar bcsg-solution-jar-with-dependencies.jar \<optional-file-path\>

- by default it looks for a file called "mid-test.csv" in the current directory;
- you can pass a parameter with a different file path;
